## Instructor: [Derek Jensen][instructor url]

Almost every mobile app needs to store and retrieve data.  It's great to build a distributed app that connects to cloud-based data stores, but you can't always rely on the user's connectivity. That means your app still needs to work even if the user isn't online, which might add a lot of complexity.

In this course, Derek Jensen will show you why the Realm Mobile Database can make your life as an iOS app developer simpler by solving the problem of seamless, always-available, cloud-based data storage. The Realm Mobile Database is fast and powerful enough to handle your largest applications, while still being easy enough for beginners to pickup without much trouble. Follow along and you'll learn the basics of getting up and running quickly. In a few short lessons, you'll learn how to build an app with Realm Mobile Database.
